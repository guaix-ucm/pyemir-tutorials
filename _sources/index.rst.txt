EMIR and MEGARA tutorials
=========================

Welcome. This is page shows tutorials of the data reduction pipelines (DRP) 
of the instruments EMIR_ and MEGARA_ at GTC_.

EMIR is a **wide-field, near-infrared, multi-object spectrograph** 
installed at the Nasmyth focus of GTC. Its MOS mode allows observers to obtain
**tens of intermediate-resolution spectra simultaneously** in the nIR bands *Y,
J, H* and *K*. EMIR is designed to address the science goals of the proposing
team and of the Spanish community at large.

MEGARA is a **optical integral field unit and multi-object spectrograph**.
It offers the Large Compact Bundle (LCB) mode, an 
Integral Field Unit (IFU) covering 12.5” x 11.3” on the sky with a spaxel 
size of 0.62” and a Multi-Object Spectroscopy (MOS) mode that allows 
observing 100 objects in a region of 3.5’ x 3.5’ around the LCB IFU. 
Both the LCB IFU and MOS capabilities of MEGARA provide intermediate-to-high spectral resolutions (R~6004, 11000 and 18700).
